# File Organizer notes
Develop a script that organizes files in a directory based on their file types.
## Requirements
1. File handling: Traverse directories and move files to appropriate folders.
2. Modules and packages: Organize sorting logic, configuration, and logging into separate modules.
3. Metaprogramming: Dynamically add new file type categories without modifying the core logic.
4. Error Handling: Manage permissions issues and handle non-existent directories.
5. Regular expressions: Identify file types using pattern matching.
