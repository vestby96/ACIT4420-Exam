## Structure requirements
1. Main module (main.py): The entry point of your application. It should orchestrate the program’s functionality by calling appropriate functions or classes from other modules.
2. Custom modules: Implement at least three key functions or classes, each addressing a specific aspect of the problem. Organize these into separate files (e.g., module1.py, module2.py, etc.).
3. File Handling: Incorporate functionality that reads from or writes to files (e.g., configuration files, logs, data storage).
4. Metaprogramming: Apply metaprogramming techniques such as decorators or dynamic class modifications to enhance your code’s flexibility and maintainability.
5. Error Handling: Implement custom error handling to manage runtime issues like file not found, invalid inputs, or network errors.
6. Regular expressions: Use regular expressions for tasks such as input validation, data parsing, or pattern matching where applicable.
7. Testing: Write unit tests for your functions or classes using pytest. Ensure that your tests cover various scenarios and edge cases. (optional)
